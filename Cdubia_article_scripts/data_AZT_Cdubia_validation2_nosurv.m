% prepare them for BYOM analyses.
%
% This file: validation data set for AZT in Daphnia magna. Data received
% as text files from Marie Trijau (Ibacon) on 25/6/2021 by email.
% Specifications:
% - Repro data are live offspring only. Since there is a direct effect on
%   offspring this is the best way to include mortality in the analysis
%   without additional survival module for the neonates in the brood pouch.
% - -1 in repro data specifies first egg appearance, and moults without
%   neonate release.
% - A NaN for repro data is entered on the time point AFTER mother dies, so
%   any repro is still accounted for. At this moment, make_repro_ind does 
%   NOT compensate this situation with weight factor or averaged-expected
%   repro.
% 
% - Repro is quite erratic with individuals releasing on neonates on
% consecutive days. Also in the controls.
% 
% Modifications made by Tjalling Jager:
% - The file for length data was unicode text rather than tab-delimited.
% - Added a -1 at several positions in T2-T6, at places where I suspect a 
%   moult without neonate release.
